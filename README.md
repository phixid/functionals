# Subterfuge

A functional Javascript library to use and learn from! The idea is two-fold. A library 
to make your daily life easier as well as teach you the concepts behind functional programming.

Subterfuge will provide you with the means to rewrite the library. This means 
you will be able to implement the behaviour yourself using the test-suite of 
the library, making sure your own implementation behaves as expected. Let's dive in!
